Hello there my name is Jimmy Kane, I am 25 year old and currently reside in Bensalem, Pennsylvania where I was born & raised.  I am trying to give back to the community that helped me grow into the man I am today.  Aside from working my day job at Ford Motor Company I try my best to give back to the youth.  

### Robotics
As a Bensalem High School student I helped found the [Fightin' Robotic Owls FIRST Robotics Team](https://team5401.org) & I went on the become the program manager of the program.  Since 2023 I have rejoined the team as a Programming Mentor as well as the Volunteer Coordinator for the district event hosted at the high school.  

### Karate
In October 2022, I resumed my training in American Kempo Karate at [Action Karate Drexel Hill](https://actionkarate.net/locations/drexel-hill/).  To this day I assist with the teen/adult sparring program, adult classes, and on occasion be lead instructor for the day when needed.  In June of 2023, I tested for and achieved the ranking of Sensai and my 3rd Degree Black belt.  I continue in my training but have now begun assisting at Action Karate Hamilton in Hamilton, NJ which is a newer location with less than 150 students.  My goal is to help this new school and educate new instructors on lessons I have learned over the last 10 years of teaching karate, robotics, and programming.

### Church
In June of 2024 I was was given the opportunity to serve at my church, [Calvary Chapel of Philadelphia](http://ccphilly.org), in the [Koinonia Caf√©](https://www.restaurantji.com/pa/philadelphia/koinonia-caf-/) during the East Coast Pastors conference.  After that experience I feel in love with it (and gained an espresso addiction I didn't know I had in the process), which lead me to continue serving in the cafe weekly.  I help out anywhere I can but I volunteer on Wednesday nights & Sunday mornings for 2 of our 3 services.  I've yearned to give back to my church family and I hope to contribute more in the coming years in any way I can.
